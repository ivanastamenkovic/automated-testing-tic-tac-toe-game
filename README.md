# Tic Tac Toe - Cypress Automated Tests

This repository contains automated end-to-end (E2E) tests written in **Cypress** and **JavaScript** for a Tic Tac Toe game. The test suite ensures the game functions correctly across various scenarios, including player moves, win conditions, draws, and UI interactions.

⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
The test structure is still in development and does not yet follow best practices. Future updates will include refactoring to improve maintainability and organization.
